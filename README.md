## 🎭 The Origin Story

Picture this: A student staring at his bank account wondering if he can afford both lunch AND internet this month. That's where my coding journey *really* began—not with "Hello World," but with "Hello, Poverty." Now I'm that software engineering student who believes every problem is just an unbuilt solution waiting to be coded into existence.

I'm not just learning to code; I'm learning to think in algorithms, dream in databases, and speak fluent JSON. My superpower? Turning "wouldn't it be cool if..." into "here's the repo for that."

> **Current Status:** Debugging the universe, one API call at a time 🚀

## 🔮 The Laboratory — Projects in the Wild

### 💸 **PesaPlan** — *The Student Budget Whisperer*
```
Status: [████████░░] 80% Complete
Mood: Caffeinated and Committed
```

**The Problem:** Student finances are like quantum physics—unpredictable, confusing, and nobody really understands them.

**The Solution:** A budgeting app that actually *gets* student life. No patronizing advice, no corporate finance BS, just real tools for people with irregular income, random expenses, and big dreams on small budgets.

**Cool Features:**
- 🎯 "Broke Mode" vs "Ballin' Mode" quick toggles
- 🔮 AI-powered expense predictions (because your pizza habit is predictable)
- 📊 Visual "Am I Poor?" dashboard
- 🏆 Savings streaks with achievement badges
- ⚡ Real-time alerts: "Warning: Dinner plans detected. Current funds: Concerning."

**Built With:** React (because I like my components like my coffee—reusable), Node.js, Supabase (PostgreSQL's cooler cousin), Chart.js for those sweet dopamine-inducing graphs

**Launch Date:** When it's ready, aka "Soon™"

### 📝 **The Youth Lab** — *A Blog That Doesn't Suck*
```
Status: [█████░░░░░] Live & Evolving
Mood: Inspirational (with a side of sarcasm)
```

Not your typical "10 Ways To Be Productive" garbage blog. This is where I share the unfiltered truth about:
- 💰 Money skills they don't teach in school
- 💻 Breaking into tech when you're broke AF
- 🎯 Building stuff that matters (not another todo app)
- 🧠 Real talk about mental health in the hustle culture

**Unique Twist:** Every post includes a "TL;DR for people who skim" and a "Rabbit Hole section" for deep divers.

**Tech Stack:** Custom-built with Markdown, sprinkled with JavaScript magic, hosted on dreams and coffee

---

### 🗳️ **VoteWatch** — *Because Politicians Have Terrible Memory*
```
Status: [███░░░░░░░] 30% Complete
Mood: Optimistically Cynical
```

**The Idea:** A civic tech platform that tracks political promises with the intensity of your ex stalking your Instagram. Politicians say a lot during campaigns—this makes sure we remember ALL of it.

**What It Does:**
- 📜 Digitizes manifestos into searchable, trackable promises
- ✅ Monitors which promises are kept, broken, or "in progress" (aka forgotten)
- 📊 Visual dashboards showing accountability scores
- 🔔 Alerts when policies that affect YOU get proposed or passed
- 🗣️ Community voting on priority issues

**The Vision:** Make democracy less "vote and forget" and more "vote and hold accountable."

**Tech Arsenal:** Python (for scraping political BS), FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React for the frontend, and a lot of caffeine-fueled idealism

### 🎓 **CampusLink API** — *Connecting Campus Chaos*
```
Status: [██████░░░░] 60% Complete  
Mood: Beta Testing with Real Humans
```

An API that connects students to everything they need but can't find:
- 🔍 Lost & Found (RIP to everyone's chargers)
- 📚 Study group matchmaking
- 🚗 Ride-sharing for broke students
- 🎉 Event notifications that don't get buried in WhatsApp groups
- 🍕 Food deals around campus

**Technical Flex:** JWT authentication, role-based access, rate limiting, real-time updates via WebSockets, and documentation so good even your non-technical friend could use it.

---

### 🎲 **Side Quest Projects** *(The Graveyard of Good Intentions)*
- **WeatherMood:** Weather app that suggests music based on forecast (abandoned but legendary)
- **DebugDuck:** Rubber duck debugging tool with AI responses (still haunts my dreams)
- **QuickPoll:** Real-time polling app (finished but never deployed, RIP)

## 🧙‍♂️ The Spellbook — Skills & Tech Wizardry

<div align="center">

### **Languages I Speak (Besides English and Broken Swahili)**
```javascript
const languages = ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'PHP', 'SQL', 'HTML/CSS', 'Bash'];
console.log(`Fluent in ${languages.length} languages. Still can't talk to my crush.`);
```

</div>

### ⚡ **Frontend Sorcery**
`React` • `Tailwind CSS` • `Responsive Design` • `Component Architecture` • `State Management` • `CSS Animations` • `DOM Manipulation` • `Webpack Basics`

**Translation:** I make websites that don't look like they're from 2005

### 🔧 **Backend Alchemy**
`Node.js` • `Express.js` • `FastAPI` • `RESTful APIs` • `GraphQL` • `Middleware` • `Authentication` • `Server Architecture` • `API Security`

**Translation:** I build the invisible engines that power the magic

### 🗄️ **Database Necromancy**
`PostgreSQL` • `MySQL` • `Supabase` • `Database Design` • `Query Optimization` • `Indexing` • `Migrations` • `ACID Principles` • `Real-time Subscriptions`

**Translation:** I organize data so well, Marie Kondo would be jealous

### 🛠️ **DevOps & Tools**
`Git/GitHub` • `Linux` • `Docker` • `Postman` • `VS Code` • `CI/CD Basics` • `Nginx` • `SSH` • `Environment Variables` • `Error Handling`

**Translation:** I can deploy stuff without breaking production (most of the time)

### 🎯 **Currently Leveling Up**
- **TypeScript** (Because JavaScript with types is chef's kiss)
- **Redis** (Making things fast AF)
- **AWS/Cloud Services** (Moving beyond "works on my machine")
- **Testing** (Jest, Pytest — writing tests before bugs find production)
- **System Design** (Thinking beyond single files)
- **WebSockets & Real-time** (Because users are impatient)

## 🎪 The Human Behind The Keyboard

### ⚡ **Fun Facts & Random Truths**

- 🎵 **Music = Productivity Formula:** Lo-fi for backend logic, Afrobeat for frontend styling, complete silence for debugging (aka panic mode)
- 🔧 **Unofficial Tech Support:** My family thinks I'm the IT department. No, Auntie, I can't fix your TV from here.
- 📚 **Side Project Collector:** I start projects like people start diets—with enthusiasm and questionable follow-through
- ☕ **Coffee Dependency:** My blood type is JavaScript with a shot of espresso
- 🐛 **Bug Whisperer:** I've had conversations with my code at 3 AM that were more meaningful than most human interactions
- 🎮 **Gaming Reference:** My GitHub contributions graph looks like a rhythm game scorecard
- 🌍 **Mission:** Build tech that empowers, not excludes. If my grandma can't use it, I haven't done my job.
- 💭 **Philosophy:** Code is poetry, bugs are plot twists, and every error message is a learning opportunity

### 🎯 **What Drives Me**

I'm not here to just add another CRUD app to the internet. I'm here because I believe:
- Technology should solve **real** problems, not create new ones
- Good software is like good conversation—clear, helpful, and doesn't waste your time
- The best developers are teachers, not gatekeepers
- Code without purpose is just expensive poetry

### 💭 *"Build. Break. Learn. Repeat."*

**Translation:** Every bug is a feature in disguise. Every failure is data. Every project is a step toward mastery. I don't fear breaking things—I fear not building them in the first place.
