## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **software engineering student** who believes the best way to learn is by building things that solve real problems. I'm passionate about creating tools that make everyday life smoother—especially for students navigating the chaos of budgets, deadlines, and dreams.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, I'm exploring how technology can bridge gaps in civic engagement, financial literacy, and youth empowerment. I love the moment when an API finally returns the right data, when a database query runs in milliseconds, and when users say "this actually helps."

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- 🎵 I debug better with music—hip hop for frontend, lo-fi for backend logic
- 🔧 I'm the unofficial tech support for everyone I know (no, I can't fix your printer remotely)
- 📚 I collect half-finished side projects like Pokemon cards
- ☕ My code-to-coffee ratio is approximately 100 lines per cup
- 🎮 I treat Stack Overflow like a co-developer on every project
- 🌍 I believe tech should empower, not exclude—building for everyone matters

## 💭 Philosophy

> **"Build. Break. Learn. Repeat."**

Every bug is a lesson. Every feature is an experiment. Every project is a step toward understanding not just *how* to code, but *why* it matters.

I don't just want to write code—I want to write code that makes someone's day easier, their work more efficient, or their voice more heard.
